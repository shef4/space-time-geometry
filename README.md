# Ripples in Spacetime: A Probabilistic Framework for Quantum Dynamics

## Overview

This repository presents a novel approach to interpreting quantum wavefunctions as dynamic ripples in higher-dimensional spacetime. The framework integrates rigorous mathematical foundations, simulations, and visualizations to explore quantum mechanics' probabilistic and spacetime-related phenomena. It delves into key concepts such as matter-antimatter symmetry, parallel universes, and energy conservation.

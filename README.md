# Space-Time Geometry Framework

## Overview
This repository contains the **Space-Time Geometry Framework** for visualizing quantum wavefunctions with time treated as a spatial-like dimension. The framework uses a polar (or cylindrical) coordinate representation of spacetime, incorporates phase encoding via hue, and provides both a theoretical foundation and practical examples (e.g., Klein–Gordon, Dirac, double-slit, tunneling scenarios).

### Key Features
- **Polar-Coordinate Wavefunction Mapping**: Transforms \((x,t)\to(r,\theta)\) to unify time and space in a single 2D or 3D plot.
- **Phase Encoding**: Visualizes quantum interference through a hue-based color map.
- **Relativistic Extensions**: Includes discussions on Minkowski spacetime, Lorentz invariance, and conceptual paths toward curved metrics in general relativity.
- **Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)**: Demonstrates how separate “branches” can be represented as orthogonal angular sectors.

## Description of Major Components

1. **`appendices/`**

   - Each appendix is split into its own file/folder for detailed derivations, MWI discussion, implementation notes, and relativistic extensions.
   - **`1_detailed_mathematical_derivations`**: Covers rigorous proofs of wavefunction normalization, coordinate transformations, phase encoding, etc.
   - **`2_mwi_visualization_and_case_studies`**: Showcases Gaussian packets, double-slit experiments, entanglement, and more—mapped into the polar/hue space.
   - **`3_code_implementation_considerations`**: Addresses performance, parallelization, color map strategies, and integration with simulation libraries.
   - **`4_extensions_to_general_relativity_and_metric_comparisons`**: Explores applying the framework to curved spacetimes and advanced GR scenarios.

2. **`paper/`**

   - Houses the main LaTeX paper (`ripples_in_spacetime.tex`), which compiles into `ripples_in_spacetime.pdf`.
   - `images/` is a placeholder (or actual) directory for figures referenced in the paper.
   - The auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.bbl`, `.blg`, `.log`, `.toc`, etc.) are auto-generated by LaTeX.
   - `references.bib` contains all citations used in the paper (BibTeX format).

3. **`draft_paper.ipynb`**

   - An optional Jupyter notebook for prototyping, data analysis, or interactive exploration of wavefunction transformations.
   - May also store small code snippets for testing numeric methods.

4. **`profile.prof`**

   - Profiling data for performance (if you used a profiler on any code).
   - Might help optimize wavefunction simulations or large-scale rendering.

5. **`requirements.txt`**

   - Lists Python or LaTeX packages (if any) required to replicate the environment.
   - If the project uses a Python-based simulation, this helps others install dependencies easily (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

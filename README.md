# Geometries of Time as a 4th Spatial Dimension

## Overview

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and resources for the research project on the geometries of time as a fourth spatial dimension with considerations of quantum mechanics. The goal of this project is to explore how this description can solve different paradoxes and to provide mathematical proofs supporting the theory.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed steps and calculations.
  - `1_Existence_Uniqueness_Solutions.ipynb`: Proof of the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the wave equation.
  - `2_Relativistic_Invariance.ipynb`: Demonstration of the model's respect for the principles of relativity.
  - `3_Quantum_Consistency.ipynb`: Proof of the evolution of spin states in accordance with quantum mechanics.
  
- **Data**: Any datasets used or generated during the research.
  
- **Figures**: Contains visualizations, diagrams, and figures used in the notebooks and final paper.
